        StartupRadar to 10x their efficiency when sourcing startups. Not another platform:
        bring your own workflow We offer a simple, well-documented REST-API you can
        use however you like. No need to use some sophisticated SaaS tool. No need
        to share your data with anyone. Just integrate it into your current stack.
        Building own scrapers is expensive and inefficient The most successful funds
        are using technology to become data driven. But building sophisticated technology
        with 2% management fee is hard. We build scrapers and intelligence for you,
        so you can focus on making the best deals and supporting your portfolio. Act
        and decide on data, don't search for it You can only screen a limited number
        of sources every few weeks. Our scrapers check 850+ sources and 100k pages
        daily. With our API, you can fetch the newest discoveries instantly and don't
        lose access by being too late. Startup Platforms and Company Registers are
        too late After three years of building an early-stage fund from scratch, one
        thing was obvious to us: when startups appear at company registers or startup
        platforms, it's already too late. At this point, you've lost your edge to
        get into a hot deal early. Don't re-invent the wheel, leverage our expertise
        instead We've been building crawlers and scrapers for the last ten years and
        technology for investors for more than five years. Don't waste time duplicating
        that effort and use our data instead. Save the time, budget, and maintenance
        efforts. Keep expertise in-house You leverage our data, but don't need to
        feed data back. This way, your expertise and algorithms stay inhouse and you
        don't give away your competitive advantage when sourcing the best deals. Don't
        pay for a platform you don't need Competitors require you to use a platform
        you don't need. And you always give away important insights to them. Which
        deals you look at and even how you rate startups. We just provide an API,
        no UI, no tracking, just data. Integrates with the tools investors love With
        our flexible API, we can integrate with almost every solution on the market.
